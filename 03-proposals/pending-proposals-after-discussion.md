### (preparation)

- have a good understanding of the context of the change (who is this change for)
- find out where the change needs to be made in the production code
- which level are the tests written for (unit, integration, ATDD, Acceptance, et...)
- add monitoring checks, if applicable
- commit and push after each passing test
- (Green) consider using Transformation Priority Premises to evolve your code
